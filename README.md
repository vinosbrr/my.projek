# my.project
my.projek is a structured repository containing configuration scripts and documentation for various server services based on *Debian 9*, running on *Virtual Machines (VMware/VirtualBox)*. This project was created as part of a learning journey and exploration in building and managing computer Network System Administration independently.

This repository is designed to simplify understanding and implementation of core server services commonly used in local networks (intranet), and to serve as a practical reference for students, network technicians, and system administrators.

This script is created by [Vinosbrr](https://github.com/vinosbrr) using Virtual Machine, Debian 9 iso, and the brain library. The script is currently in the development phase (BETA), so there may still be some errors that can be ignored. If errors persist even after debugging, please contact the owner for assistance. ~ By Vinosbrr

## Project Structure
This repository consists of several service directories, each containing its own documentation and configuration scripts:

### 1. [DHCP Server](./dhcp-server)
Provides a **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** service for automatically assigning IP addresses to devices in the network.

### 2. [FTP Server](./ftp-server)
Configuration of a **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)** server, enabling file transfer between devices using a fast and easy-to-use protocol.

### 3. [Remote Server (SSH)](./remote-server)
Setup of a **Secure Shell (SSH)** server for secure remote access and server management via encrypted connections.

### 4. [Web Server (Apache2)](./web-server)
Implementation of an **Apache2 web server** to serve both static and dynamic web pages in local or public environments.

### 5. [DNS Server (Bind9)](./dns-server)
Configuration of a **Domain Name System (DNS)** service using **Bind9** to resolve domain names to IP addresses locally.

### 6. [Database Server (MySQL & PhpMyAdmin)](./database-server)
Installation and management of a **MySQL Server** with a web-based interface using **PhpMyAdmin** for efficient database administration.

### 7. [Mail Server](./mail-server)
Setup of a local **mail server** using **Postfix** and **Dovecot**, supporting email sending via **SMTP**, and receiving via **POP3/IMAP**. Ideal for testing and internal network simulation.
