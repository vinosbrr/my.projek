## WEB SERVER
A web server setup script created by Vinosbrr, designed to automate the configuration of a basic Apache2 web server environment on Debian 9 using a virtual machine. This project is experimental and intended for educational or testing purposes only.
 
## What is a Web Server?
A web server is software that handles requests from clients (usually web browsers) and responds by delivering web pages or other resources over the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. The web server acts as a “bridge” between users and website content, ensuring that page requests are processed correctly and efficiently.

Core components of a Web server:
- Apache2: One of the most popular and widely used open-source web server software in the world. It's stable, flexible, and highly configurable.
- Virtual Hosts: Allow a single Apache server to host multiple websites with different domain names.
- Document Root: The main directory where website files are stored.
- .conf Configuration Files: Configuration files used to define server settings such as ports, domains, SSL, and more.
- Log Files: Store access and error logs to monitor traffic and diagnose issues.
